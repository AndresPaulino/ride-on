# Hi, I'm Andres! ðŸ‘‹

## ðŸš€ About Me
I'm a passionate full stack developer focusing on the MERN stack. I love to create, find problems and come up with simple, yet powerful solutions. This is my capstone
project for the graduation of the March 2022 BrainStation Web Development Cohort. 

## What I Learned

This project was extremely fun for me. I was able to quickly identify features and bugs and implement a quick path to develop. I learned how to manipulate MySQL database,
with many to many relationships, using knex.js on server-side.

I learned how to use TailwindCSS very comfortably and how to implement third party APIs like Google Maps and Leaflet.
